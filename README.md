### A simple music visualizer

Reacts to the beat, tries to automatically compensate for continuously low or high amplitudes.  
This originally had to analyze speech, but ended up to be just goofing around with Eigen/FFT.  
Currently has no support for stereo tracks. They do work, but produce incorrect results.
